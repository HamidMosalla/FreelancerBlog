# WebForAspNetCore
I've started building this project when Asp.Net RC1 was released, and I added new features to it and upgrade it ever since. At first my intention was to fiddle with Asp.Net Core a little to learn, but then I've decided to make it into a project that can be useable. This project didn't build to be a flexible CMS, but that doesn't mean you can't use bits and pieces of it in your project, because many part of this project are needs that reoccur.
